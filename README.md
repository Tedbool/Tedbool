# Hello! I'm Teddy

## I'm a junior front end developer <br/> I am eager to learn new technologies and platforms!

---------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my friend's portfolio

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning react and advanced css + scss

---------------------------------------------------------
I started my fullstack course on September 2021 and been eager to advance in the field ever since

I worked at LS Technologies as an intern on a project called [Skill-il](https://skillil.co.il/)

Nowadays I look for projects to do by myself focusing on react
